## What Is Whisper AI

Whisper AI is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained with data over 680,000 hours of multilingual data collected from the web. It was developed by OpenAI

With Whisper AI you transcribe speech in over 100 languages, covert any video, audio to text also translate transcribed text into Any Language

With Whisper AI you can:

Transcribe Video, Audio, meetings, and other audio recordings

Get Subtitles for videos

Developing voice assistants and other speech-enabled applications

## Here are some examples of how Whisper AI can be used:

- A journalist can use Whisper AI to transcribe interviews with people who speak different languages, without having to hire a translator.

- A student can use Whisper AI to transcribe lectures and meetings, so that they can focus on listening and participating, rather than taking notes.

- A podcaster can use Whisper AI to create subtitles for their videos, so that they can reach a wider audience.

- A business can use Whisper AI to transcribe customer calls and feedback, so that they can better understand their customers and improve their products and services.

The Whisper AI API endpoint is a REST API that allows developers to access the Whisper AI model to transcribe or translate speech. The API is available through the OpenAI platform, and requires an API key to access.

The API has two endpoints:

Transcriptions: This endpoint transcribes audio into the language in which it is spoken.

Translations: This endpoint transcribes audio into English.

Both endpoints accept a variety of audio formats, including MP3, MP4, WAV, and WEBM.

To use the API, developers must send a POST request to the appropriate endpoint, with the audio file attached. The API will then return a JSON response containing the transcribed text.

## Here is an example of a POST request to the transcriptions endpoint:

````POST /v1/audio/transcriptions HTTP/1.1
Host: api.openai.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: multipart/form-data```

```{
  "audio": "@audio.mp3"
}```
The API will return a JSON response containing the transcribed text, for example:

JSON
````

{
"id": "1234567890",
"text": "This is an example of transcribed text."
}```
Use code with caution

For more information on how to use the Whisper AI API, please see the OpenAI documentation: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text

## Here are some examples of how the Whisper AI API can be used:

A developer could use the API to create a transcription service for businesses or individuals.

A developer could use the API to create a voice assistant that can transcribe and translate speech in real time.

A developer could use the API to create a tool that can automatically transcribe and translate videos.

A developer could use the API to create a tool that can help people with hearing disabilities to communicate more effectively.

The Whisper AI API is a powerful tool that can be used to create a wide range of innovative applications.
